\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Lift up your hearts, Emmanuel's friends\\
And taste the pleasure Jesus sends\\
Let nothing cause you to delay\\
But hasten in the good old way

\begin{chorus}
    For I have a sweet hope of glory in my soul\\
    I have a sweet hope of glory in my soul\\
    For I know I have, and I feel I have\\
    A sweet hope of glory in my soul
    \end{chorus}

Our conflicts here, though great they be\\
Shall not prevent our victory\\
If we but strive and watch and pray\\
Like soldiers in the good old way

Though Satan may his powers employ\\
Our happiness for to destroy\\
Yet never fear, we'll gain the day\\
By marching in the good old way

Ye valiant souls, for heaven contend\\
Remember glory is at the end\\
Our God will wipe our tears away\\
When we have run the good old way

And far beyond this mortal shore\\
We'll meet with those who have gone before\\
And shout to think we have gained the day\\
By marching in the good old way
\end{verse}
