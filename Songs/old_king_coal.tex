\poemtitle{Old King Coal}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Under the ground lay Old King Coal\\
He lay most peacefully\\
He ruled in might and splendour\\
There was none so grand as he\\
But men came along to tunnel him out\\
And topple him from his throne\\
The tore him down to steal his crown\\
For the power in the old black stone

\begin{chorus}
There's fire in the heart of Old King Coal\\
There's the strength of centuries in his soul\\
There's a power that grows where his black blood flows\\
So here's to Old King Coal
\end{chorus}

So they scratched him, hacked him, and harried him out\\
They ripped him from his bed\\
And they blasted his bones asunder\\
They'd sworn to see him dead\\
Then they carried him out to the sun's bright light\\
Which blinded him in the eye\\
And the blood did drain from every vein\\
Until they'd drained him dry

Then they cracked his bones on the grinding stones\\
How gleefully they did grind\\
Oh how they pulverized him\\
Turned him to dust so fine\\
Then they sprayed him into the furnace fire\\
And burned him in the air\\
With a mighty blast they burned him fast\\
As he prayed his final prayer


And his soul cried out with a final song\\
As he reached his final hour\\
And his heart it burst with singing\\
So mighty was the power\\
And he sang the water into steam\\
And the steam mnade the wheels fly round\\
And the song ran on both pure and strong\\
Till the wires hummed with its sound

Out of the darkness there comes light\\
Out of the earth comes fire\\
Out of the cold comes comfort\\
As his bones go blazing higher\\
And his soul flies out through the air we breathe\\
And down on the earth we tread\\
That humankind may not forget\\
That Old King Coal is dead
