\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better.\\
He fairly won my heart, he wrote me a letter.\\
With his hammer in his hand he looked so clever\\
And if I were with my love I would live forever.

Oh where has my love gone with his cheeks like roses?\\
He's gone across the sea, gathering primroses.\\
I'm afraid the shining sun might burn and scorch his beauty\\
And if I were with my love I would do my duty.

Strange news has come to town, strange news is carried.\\
Strange news flies up and down that my love is married.\\
Oh I wish them both much joy though they don't hear me\\
And if I were with my love I would do my duty.

Oh what did you promise me when you lay beside me?\\
You said you'd marry me and not deny me.\\
If I said I'd marry you it was only to try you\\
So bring your witness love and I'll not deny you.

Oh witness have I none save God Almighty.\\
And may He reward you well for the slighting of me.\\
Her lips grew pale and wan, it made her poor heart tremble,\\
For to think she had loved one and he'd proved deceitful.
