\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
1 As it fell out upon one day \\
Rich Diverus made a feast, \\
And he invited all his friends\\ 
And the gentry of the best 

2 Then Lazarus laid him down\\
And down at Diverus’ door.\\
Some meat, some drink, brother Lazarus,\\
And bestow it upon the poor.

3 Thou art none of my brother, Lazarus,\\
Lies begging at my door.\\
No meat nor drink will I give thee,\\
Nor bestow it upon the poor.

4 Then Lazarus laid him down\\
And down by Diverus wall.\\
Some meat, some drink, brother Lazarus,\\
Or with hunger starve I shall.

5 Thou art none of my brother, Lazarus,\\
Lies begging at my wall,\\
No meat nor drink will I give thee,\\
For hunger starve thou shall.

6 Then Lazarus laid him down\\
And down by Diverus gate.\\
Some meat, some drink, brother Lazarus,\\
For Jesus Christ his sake.

7 Then Diverus sent out his hungry dogs\\
To bite him as he lay\\
And they had no power to bite one bite\\
And they licked his sores away.

8 Then Diverus sent out his merry men all\\
To whip poor Lazarus away\\
And they had no power to strike one stroke,\\
But they flung their whips away.

9 As it fell out upon one day\\
Poor Lazarus sickened and died\\
And there came two angels out of heaven\\
His soul there for to guide.

10 Rise up, rise up, brother Lazarus,\\
And come along with me,\\
There is a place prepared in heaven\\
To sit on an angel’s knee.

11 As it fell out upon one day\\
Rich Diverus sickened and died\\
And there come two serpents out of-hell\\
His soul there for to guide.

12 Rise us, rise up, brother Diverus,\\
And come along with me,\\
There is a place prepared in hell\\
From which thou canst not flee.

13 Then Diverus lifted up his heavy, heavy eyes\\
And saw poor Lazarus blest.\\
One drop of water wilt thou, Lazarus,\\
To quench my flaming thirst.

14 If I'd as many years to live\\
As there is blades of grass,\\
Then there would be an end in time\\
But Hell's pains will never be passed.

15 If I had got my tune again\\
The space of one half hour,\\
I'd make myself so perfect cure\\
As the Devil should have no power.
