\begin{chorus}
Hey ho the Rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valley oh\\
Hey ho the Rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valley oh
\end{chorus}

\begin{patverse}
And in that bog there was a tree,\\
\textit{Rare tree, a Rattlin' tree,}\\
Tree in the bog and the bog down in the valley oh
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
And on that tree there was a branch,\\
\textit{Rare branch, a Rattlin' branch,}\\
Branch on the tree and the tree in the bog\\
and the bog down in the valley oh
\end{patverse}

On that branch there was a twig

On that twig there was a leaf

On that leaf there was a nest

In that nest there was an egg

On that egg there was a bird

On that bird there was a wing

On that wing there was a feather

On that feather there was a flea
\end{verse}
