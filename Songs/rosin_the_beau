\begin{patverse}
I've travelled all over this world,\\
And now to another I'll go.\\
And I know that good quarters are waiting,\\
To welcome old Rosin the Beau.\\
To welcome old Rosin the Beau,\\
To welcome old Rosin the Beau.\\
And I know that good quarters are waiting,\\
To welcome old Rosin the Beau.
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
When I'm dead and laid out on the counter,\\
A voice you will hear from below.\\
Saying: ``Send down a hogshead of whisky,\\
To drink with old Rosin the Beau.''\\
To drink with old Rosin the Beau\dots{}
\end{patverse}

Then get half a dozen stout fellows,\\
And let them all stagger and go.\\
And dig a great hole in the meadow,\\
And in it put Rosin the Beau.

Then get ye a couple of bottles,\\
Put one at me head and me toe.\\
With a diamond ring scratch upon them\\
The name of old Rosin the Beau

I feel that old tyrant approaching,\\
That cruel and remorseless old foe.\\
And I lift up me glass in his honour:\\
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau


\end{verse}
