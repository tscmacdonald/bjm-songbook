\poemtitle{The Nutting Girl}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Come all you jovial fellows, come listen to my song\\
It is a little ditty, and it won't contain you long\\
It's of a fair young damsel, she liv\'{e}d down in Kent,\\
Rose one summer's morning, and she a nutting went.

\begin{chorus}
With me fal-lal-lal to me ral-tal-lal,\\
Whack for the dear old day,\\
And what few nuts that poor girl had she threw them all away.
\end{chorus}

It's of a fine young farmer who was ploughing of his land,\\
He called unto his horses, and he bid them gently stand.\\
As he sat down all on his plough, all for a song to sing\\
His voice was so melodious, it made the valleys ring

And it's of this fair young damsel, she was nutting in a wood,\\
His voice was so melodious it charmed her where she stood.\\
His voice was so melodious, she could no longer stay,\\
And what few nuts that she had found, she threw them all away

She then came to young Johnny as he sat on his plough,\\
She said `Young man, I think I feel I cannot tell you how'\\
He took her to some shady broom and there he laid her down;\\
She said, `Young man, I think I feel the world go round and round

Now come all you young women, this warning take by me\\
If you should a-nutting go, please be home by tea;\\
For if you should stay out too late to hear that ploughboy sing,\\
You might have a young farmer to nurse up in the spring.
\end{verse}
