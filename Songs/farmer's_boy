\poemtitle{The Farmer's Boy}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

The sun had set behind yon hill across yon dreary moor,\\
When weary and lame a poor boy came up to a farmer's door.\\
``Can you tell me where'er there be one that will me employ?\\
\begin{chorus}
To plough and sow, to reap and mow\\
To be a farmer's boy, to be a farmer's boy.''
\end{chorus}

``My father's dead, my mother's left with five children large and small,\\
And what is worse for my mother still, I'm the largest of them all.\\
Though little I am, I would labour hard if I could find employ''


``And if you will not me employ, one favour I do ask:\\
Shelter me till the break of day from this cold winter's blast.\\
At the break of day I'll win my way, I'll swear to seek employ''


The farmer's wife said, ``Try the lad, Let him no longer seek.''\\
``Yes, father do,'' the daughter cried, as the tears rolled down her cheek.\\
``For those who would work 'tis hard to want, and wander for employ.''


The farmer's boy grew up a man and the good old couple died,\\
Leaving the lad the farm they had, and their daughter for his bride.\\
Now the lad which was, a man now is, often thinks and smiles with joy\\
\begin{chorus}And he blesses the day he came that way\\
To be a farmer's boy, to be a farmer's boy.\end{chorus}
