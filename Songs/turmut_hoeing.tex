\poemtitle{Turmut Hoeing}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Now I be a turmut hoer, from Somersetshire I came\\
My parents were hard-working folks, Giles Webster be my name\\
I arose one summer's morning, e'en at the break of day\\
I took my hoe and away did go, some fifty miles away

\begin{chorus}
Now, some delight in hay-making, while some be fond of mowing\\
But of all the jobs that I like best, gi'e I the turmut hoeing\\
For the fly, the fly, the fly is on the turmut,\\
And it's all me eye for I to try to keep 'e off the turmut
\end{chorus}

I be a tidy sort of a chap and soon got I a place\\
Like any Turk I went to work, and took it by the piece\\
I hoed away quite cheerfully, for good old Farmer Gower\\
Who vowed and swore and said I were a ripping turmut hoer

In winter we drives oxen about the fields a ploughing\\
For to keep the furrow straight and true all ready for turmut sowing\\
But when the frost bars up the wheels, out on the land we're going\\
For without manure `tis certain sure no turmuts won't be growing.

When summer time it comes around, the work it turns to mowing\\
But I like none of it half so well as I do me turmut hoeing\\
And when the harvest now begins, and the nut-brown ale's a-flowing\\
I merely bids them all good bye, and I'm off to turmut hoeing
\end{verse}
