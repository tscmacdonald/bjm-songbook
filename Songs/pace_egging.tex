\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\\
\begin{chorus}
Here's one--two--three jolly lads, all of one mind\\
We've come a pace egging, and we hope you'll prove kind.\\
And we hope you'll prove kind, with your eggs and strong beer\\
And we'll come no more nigh you until the next year
\end{chorus}

The first that comes in is Lord Nelson you'll see\\
With a bunch of blue ribbons tied round at his knee\\
And a star on his breast, that like silver does shine\\
And I hope he remembers it's pace egging time

Well the next that comes in it is Lord Collingwood\\
And he's fought with Lord Nelson till he shed his blood\\
And he's come from the sea old England to view\\
He's come a pace egging with the whole of his crew

And the last that comes in is old Tosspot, you'll see\\
He's a valiant old fellow in every degree\\
He's a valiant old man and he wears a pigtail\\
And it's all his delight in a-drinking strong ale

Come ladies and gentlemen, sit by the fire\\
Put your hands in your pockets and give us our desire\\
Put your hands in your pockets and treat us all right\\
If you give nought, we'll take nought, farewell and goodnight!

\end{verse}
