\begin{patverse*}
Oh the year was Seventeen Seventy-Eight\\
\textit{How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!}\\
A letter of marque came from the king,\\
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
\end{patverse*}

\begin{chorus}
God damn them all\\
I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold\\
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears;\\
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier,\\
The last of Barrett's Privateers.
\end{chorus}



O Elcid Barrett cried the town\\
For twenty brave men all fishermen who\\
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight\\
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags\\
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags


On the King's birthday we put to sea\\
Ninety-one days to Montego Bay\\
Pumping like madmen all the way

On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again\\
When a bloody great Yankee hove into sight\\
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight

The Yankee lay low down with gold\\
She was broad and fat and loose in stays\\
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

Then at length she stood two cables away\\
Our cracked four-pounders made awful din\\
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side\\
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs\\
And the main truck carried off both me legs

Now here I lay in my twenty-third year\\
It's been six years since we sailed away\\
And I just made Halifax yesterday
