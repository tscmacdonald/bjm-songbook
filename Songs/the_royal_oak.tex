\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I have to close one eye to read the label on the drink\\
I'm having trouble walking and I'm spewing in the sink\\
I can't go to bed yet because I'm on the ran-tan\\
There's a scotch at the bar and a beer in my hand


\begin{chorus}
So hereâ€™s to the drink my boys, here's to that drop of pure\\
Here's to the bar maid, and here's to the brewer\\
And here's to the girls we've had and lost along the way\\
Here's to tonight and here's to the next day
\end{chorus}

The girls they are all dancing and the locals all complain\\
About the new folk at the pub or about the lack of rain\\
There's a pretty thing at the bar but she'll have none of me\\
So I'll go and have a smoke and wish this beer was free


So good health to the publican, may he never close his doors\\
For while the amber's flowing we will always drink more\\
But when the bottle's dry and the taps are pouring foam\\
We'll get another for the road and then we'll head on home


The sun light she trickles in, the morn she comes so fast\\
I've woken up in a daze, a hand still on the glass\\
Around me lie the casualties of this drunken night\\
The women and the men who joined me on this boozy plight
