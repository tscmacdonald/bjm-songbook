\begin{patverse}
Have ye heard how the wars began,\\
\textit{Benjamin Bowmaneer?}\\
Have ye heard how the wars began\\
\textit{Castors away!}\\
Have ye heard how the wars began,\\
When England fought to a man?\\
\textit{And the proud tailor rode prancing away}
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
Of his shear-board he made a horse,\\
\textit{Benjamin Bowmaneer!}\\
Of his shear-board he made a horse\\
\textit{Castors away!}\\
Of his shear-board he made a horse\\
All for him to ride across\\
\textit{And the proud tailor rode prancing away}
\end{patverse}

Of his scissors he made bridle-bits\\
To keep his horse in its wits

As the tailor rode o'er the lea\\
He spied a flea on his knee

Of his needle he made a spear\\
To prick that flea through its ear

Of his thimble he made a bell\\
To ring that flea's funeral knell

`Twas thus that the wars began\\
When England fought to a man
\end{verse}
