\poemtitle{I Went to Market}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I went to market to buy a cock, and the cock did very well please me.\\
Every time I fed my cock I fed him all under a tree,\\
And my cock went ``cock, and cock, and cock, and cock-a-doodle-doo,''\\
And after every farmer's cock did my cock crow.

Well, I went to market to buy a pig, and my pig did very well please me.\\
Every time I fed my pig I fed her all under a tree,\\
And my pig went ``oink'',\\
My cock went ``cock, and cock, and cock, and cock-a-doodle-doo,''\\
And after every farmer's cock did my cock crow.

Goose\dots gaggle

Duck\dots quack

Horse\dots neigh

\textit{etc}

Wife\dots Damnit!
