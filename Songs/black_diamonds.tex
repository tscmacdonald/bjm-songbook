\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\begin{altverse}
Oh clubs will make you wonder, so don't make that mistake\\
Way down black diamonds to be found\\
Oh spades are made for digging boys, hearts'll only break\\
Looking for black diamonds a mile beneath the ground
\end{altverse}

\begin{chorus}
It's way down black diamonds to be found\\
Down in the darkness, that's where we are bound\\
Way down black diamonds to be found\\
Shining in the lamplight a mile beneath the ground
\end{chorus}

\begin{altverse}
Oh dust it slowly kills ye, but what else can you do?\\
Way down black diamonds to be found\\
It makes your throat like ashes, your cuts and scars go blue\\
Looking for black diamonds a mile beneath the ground
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
See them wear their chains of silver, they're wearing rings of gold\\
Way down black diamonds to be found\\
They'll be glad of some black diamonds, when their nights are turning cold\\
Looking for black diamonds a mile beneath the ground
\end{altverse}

\begin{altverse}
Oh clubs will make you wonder, so don't make that mistake\\
Way down black diamonds to be found\\
Oh spades are made for digging boys, hearts'll only break\\
Looking for black diamonds a mile beneath the ground
\end{altverse}
