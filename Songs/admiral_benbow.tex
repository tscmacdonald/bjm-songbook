\begin{patverse}
Come all you seamen bold\\
\textit{Come all you seamen bold}\\
And draw near,\\
\textit{And draw near,}\\
Come all you seamen bold and draw near.\\
‘Tis of an Admirals fame, and brave Benbow was his name;\\
How he fought all on the main \\
You shall hear,\\
\textit{You shall hear.}
\end{patverse}

Brave Benbow he set sail,\\
For to fight,\\
Brave Benbow he set sail for to fight.\\
Brave Benbow he set sail in a fine and pleasant gale,\\
But his Captains they turned pale in a fright.

Said Kirby unto Wade,\\
We will run,\\
Said Kirby unto Wade we will run.\\
For I value no disgrace nor, the losing of my place\\
But the enemy I'll not face nor his guns.

So the \textit{Ruby} and Benbow\\
Fought the French,\\
Sp the \textit{Ruby} and Benbow fought the French.\\
They fought them up and down till the blood came trickling down,\\
Till the blood came trickling down where they lay.


Brave Benbow lost his legs,\\
By chain shot,\\
Brave Benbow lost his legs by chain shot.\\
Brave Benbow lost his legs, Now it's on his stumps he pegs\\
Fight on my English lads it is our lot, `tis our lot.


Come surgeon dress my wounds,\\
Benbow cried,\\
Come surgeon dress my wounds Benbow cried.\\
Let a cradle now in haste, On the quarter deck be placed,\\
So the enemy I might face till I die.

When in death he closed his eyes\\
They all cried,\\
When in death he closed his eyes they all cried.\\
What a terrible sight to see, our brave hero of the day\\
And they carried him to Kingston church where he lay.
