\begin{verse}[\versewidth]\\

\begin{chorus}
Come landlord fill the flowing bowl \\
Until it doth run over,\\
Come landlord fill the flowing bowl\\
Until it doth run over.\\
For tonight we'll merry merry be,\\
For tonight we'll merry merry be,\\
For tonight we'll merry merry be\dots{}\\
Tomorrow we'll be sober
\end{chorus}


Here's to the man who drinks small beer,\\
And goes to bed quite sober;\\
Here's to the man who drinks small beer, \\
And goes to bed quite sober.\\
He falls as the leaves do fall,\\
He falls as the leaves do fall,\\
He falls as the leaves do fall\dots{}\\
And drops off in October.

Here's to the man who drinks strong ale,\\
And goes to bed quite mellow.\\
He lives as a man should live,\\
And dies a jolly fellow

Here's to the girl who steals a kiss,\\
And runs to tell her mother.\\
She's a very foolish thing,\\
She'll never get another

Here's to the girl who steals a kiss,\\
And stays to steal another.\\
She's a boon to all mankind,\\
And soon she'll be a mother

Come on Maud unto the grass,\\
And don't be so particular.\\
If the grass it is too wet,\\
We'll do it perpendicular!
\end{verse}
