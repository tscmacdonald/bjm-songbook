\poemtitle{Dido, Bendigo}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
As I was a-walking one morning last Autumn,\\
I've overheard some noble foxhunting\\
Between some noblemen and the Duke of Wellington\\
So early before the day was dawning.

\begin{chorus}
There was Dido, Bendigo, Gentry he was there-o;\\
Traveller he never looked behind him.\\
There was Countess, Rover, Bonnie Lass and Drover:\\
These were the hounds that could find him.
\end{chorus}

Well the first fox being young and his trials just beginning,\\
He's made straight away for his cover.\\
He's run up yon highest hill and gone down yon lowest gill,\\
Thinking that he'd find his freedom there forever.

Well the next fox being old and his trials fast a-dawning,\\
He's made straight away for the river.\\
Well the fox he has jumped in but an hound jumped after him;\\
It was Traveller who strided him for ever.

Well they've run across the plain but they've soon returned again,\\
The fox nor the hounds never failing.\\
It's been just twelve months today since I heard the squire say,\\
“Hark forward then my brave hounds forever!”
\end{verse}
