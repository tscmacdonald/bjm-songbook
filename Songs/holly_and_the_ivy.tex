1. The holly and the ivy,\\
They both were grown, you know,\\
And of all the trees that are in the wood, \\
The holly bears a crown.\\
The holly bears a blossom\\
As white as any flower,\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ\\
To be our Saviour.

2. The holly and the ivy,\\
They both were grown, you know,\\
And of all the trees that are in the wood, \\
The holly bears a crown.\\
The holly bears a berry\\
As red as any blood,\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ\\
To do poor sinners good.

3. The holly and the ivy,\\
They both were grown, you know,\\
And of all the trees that are in the wood, \\
The holly bears a crown.\\
The holly bears a prickle\\
As sharp as any thorn\\
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ\\
On Christmas Day in the morn.

4. God bless the ruler of this house\\
And send him long to reign,\\
That many a merry Christmas\\
He may live to see again.\\
God bless his friends and kindreds\\
That live both far and near,\\
God bless them and send them all\\
A happy New Year.
