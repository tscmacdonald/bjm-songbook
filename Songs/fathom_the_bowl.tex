\poemtitle{Fathom the Bowl}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Come all you bold heroes, give an ear to my song;\\
I'll sing in the praise of good brandy and rum.\\
There's a clear crystal fountain, near England doth roll\\
Bring me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.

\begin{chorus}
I'll fathom the bowl,\\
I'll fathom the bowl,\\
Bring me the punch ladle,\\
I'll fathom the bowl.
\end{chorus}

From France we get brandy, from Jamaica comes rum\\
Sweet oranges and lemos from Portugal come\\
But beer and strong cider are England's control,\\
Bring me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.

My wife, she comes in when I sit at my ease\\
She does as she likes, and she says as she please.\\
Me wife, she's the devil, she's black as the coal,\\
Bring me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.

My father, he do lie in the depths of the sea\\
No stone at his head, but what matter to he?\\
There's a clear crystal fountain, near him it doth roll\\
Bring me the punch ladle, I'll fathom the bowl.\\
\end{verse}
