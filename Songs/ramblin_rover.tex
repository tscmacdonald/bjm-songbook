\poemtitle{Ramblin' Rover}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\\
\begin{chorus}
Oh there's sober men a-plenty,\\
There are drunkards barely twenty;\\
There are men of over ninety\\
That have never yet kissed a girl.\\
But give me a rambling rover,\\
From Orkney down to Dover,\\
We will roam the country over\\
And together we'll face the world.
\end{chorus}


I've roamed through all the nations,\\
Ta'en delight in all creation;\\
And I've tried a wee sensation\\
Where the company did prove kind.\\
When parting was no pleasure\\
I've drunk another measure,\\
To the good friends that we treasure,\\
For they always are in our mind.


There's many that feign enjoyment\\
From merciless employment,;\\
Their ambition was this deployment\\
From the minute they left the school;\\
And they save and scrape and ponder,\\
While the rest go out and squander\\
See the world and rove and wander--\\
And they're happier as a rule.


If you're bent with arthritis,\\
Your bowels have got colitis,\\
You've galloping ballicitus\\
And you're thinking it's time you died.\\
If you've been a man of action\\
While you're lying there in traction,\\
You may gain some satisfaction\\
Thinking ``Jesus, at least I've tried!''\\
