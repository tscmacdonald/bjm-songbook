\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
`Oh where are you going?', said Milder to Maulder\\
`Oh we may not tell you', said Festle to Fose\\
`We're off to the woods', said John the Red Nose\\
`We're off to the woods,' said John the Red Nose

`What will you do there?' said Milder to Maulder\\
`Oh we may not tell you' said Festle to Fose\\
`We'll hunt the Cutty Wren' said John the Red Nose\\
`We'll hunt the Cutty Wren', said John the Red Nose

`How will you shoot her?' said Milder to Maulder\\
`Oh we may not tell you' said Festle to Fose\\
`With bows and with arrows' said John the Red Nose,\\
`With bows and with arrows' said John the Red Nose

`That will not do then'---`What will do then?'\\
`Great guns and great cannons'

`How will you bring her back?'---`We may not tell you'\\
`On four stout men's shoulders'

`That will not do then'---`What will do then?'\\
`Great horses and great wagons'

`How will you broil her?'---`We may not tell you'\\
`In pots and in pans'

`That will not do then'---`What will do then?'\\
 `A bloody great brass cauldron'

 `And who'll get the spare ribs?'--`We may not tell you'\\
`We'll give them all to the poor'
