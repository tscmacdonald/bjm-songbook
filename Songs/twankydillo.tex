\begin{verse}[\versewidth]


Here's a health to the jolly blacksmith, the best of all fellows;\\
Who works at his anvil while the boy blows the bellows.
\begin{chorus}
Which makes his bright hammer to rise and to fall;\\
Here's to Old Cole, and to Young Cole,\\
And to Old Cole of all;\\
Twankydillo, Twankydillo, Twankydillo-dillo-dillo-dillo\\
And a roaring pair of bagpipes made of the green willow.
\end{chorus}

Here's a health to the pretty boy, the one I love best\\
Who kindles a fire all in my own breast

If a gentleman calls his horse to be shoed\\
He'll make no denial of one pot or two

Here's a health from us all, to our sovereign the Queen\\
And to all the Royal family, wherever they're seen
\end{verse}
