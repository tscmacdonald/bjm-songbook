\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Come fill up your glasses and let us be merry,\\
For to rob and to plunder it is our intent.

\begin{chorus}
As we roam through the valleys,\\
With the lilies and the roses,\\
And the beauty of Kashmir lies drooping his head.\\
Then away, then away, then away\dots\\
To the caves in yonder mountains,\\
where the robbers retreat.
\end{chorus}

Hark, hark! In the distance there's footsteps approaching:\\
Stand, stand and deliver! Shall be our watchcry.

Your gold and your jewels, and your life if resisted;\\
We shall laugh at your agony, and scorn at your threats.

And then we'll return to our wives and our children,\\
Expecting their fathers to come robbing this way.

Come fill up your glasses, and let's be a-drinking,\\
For the moonbeams are shining all over our heads.
