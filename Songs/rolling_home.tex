\poemtitle{Rolling Home}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Round goes the wheel of fortune, don't be afraid to ride\\
There's a land of milk and honey waits on the other side\\
There'll be peace and there'll be plenty, you'll never need to roam\\
When we go rolling home, when we go rolling home

\begin{chorus}
Rolling home, when we go rolling home\\
When we go rolling, rolling\\
When we go rolling home
\end{chorus}

The gentry in their fine array, they prosper night and morn\\
While we unto the fields must go to plough and sow the corn\\
The rich they steal the power, but the glory's ours alone\\
When we go rolling home, when we go rolling home

The frost is on the hedgerow, the icy winds do blow\\
While we poor weary labourers strive through the driving snow\\
Our dreams fly up to glory of where the lark has flown\\
When we go rolling home, when we go rolling home

The summer of resentment, the winter of despair\\
The journey to contentment is set with trap and snare\\
Stand to and stand together, your labours yours alone\\
When we go rolling home, when we go rolling home

Pass the bottle round and let the toast go free\\
Here's a health to every labourer wherever they may be\\
Fair wages are now or never, let's reap what we have sown\\
When we go rolling home, when we go rolling home

\attrib{John Tams}
