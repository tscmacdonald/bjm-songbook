\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
For to see mad Tom of Bedlam\\
Ten thousand miles I'd travel\\
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes\\
For to save her shoes from gravel


\begin{chorus}
Still I sing bonnie boys, bonnie mad boys\\
    Bedlam boys are bonnie,\\
    For they all go bare and they live by the air\\
    And they want no drink nor money
    \end{chorus}

I went down to Satan's kitchen\\
For to get me food one morning\\
And there I got souls piping hot\\
All on the spit a-turning

Me staff has murdered giants\\
And me bag a long knife carries\\
For to cut mince pies from children's thighs\\
With which to feed the fairies

This spirit's white as lightning\\
Would on me travels guide me\\
The moon would shake and the stars would quake\\
When ever they espied me

And when that I have murdered\\
The man in the moon to a powder\\
His staff I'll break and his dog I'll shake\\
And there'll howl no demon louder

For to see mad Tom of Bedlam\\
Ten thousand years I'd travel\\
Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes\\
For to save her shoes from gravel
