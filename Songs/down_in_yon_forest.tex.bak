\begin{altverse}
1. Down in yon forest there stands a hall,\\
\emph{The bells of Paradise, I heard them ring}\\
It's covered all over with purple and pall\\
\emph{And I love my Lord Jesus above anything}
\end{altverse}

2. In that hall there stands a bed,\\
It's covered all over with scarlet so red.

3. In that bed there lies a knight,\\
Whose wounds do bleed by day and by night.

4. At the bedside there lies a stone,\\
Which the sweet Virgin Mary hath knelt upon.

5. Under that bed there runs a flood,\\
The one half runs water, the other runs blood.

6. At the foot of the bed there grows a thorn,\\
Which ever bore blossom since he was born.

7. Over that bed the moon shines bright,\\
Denoting our saviour was born on this night.
