  \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  At Jacob's well a stranger sought\\
  His drooping frame to cheer,\\
  His drooping frame to cheer;\\
  Samaria's daughter little thought\\
  That Jacob's God was near,\\
  Samaria's daughter little thought\\
  That Jacob's God was near.
  
  This had she known, her fainting mind,\\
  For richer draughts had sighed,\\
  For richer draughts had sighed;\\
  Nor had Messiah, ever kind,\\
  Those richer draughts denied,\\
  Nor had Messiah, ever kind,\\
  Those richer draughts denied.
  
  This ancient well, no glass so true,\\
  Britannia's image shows,\\
  Britannia's image shows;\\
  Now Jesus travels Britain through,\\
  But who the stranger knows?\\
  Now Jesus travels Britain through,\\
  But who the stranger knows?  
  
  Yet Britain must the stranger know,\\
  Or soon her loss deplore,\\
  Or soon her loss deplore;\\
  Behold, the living waters flow,\\
  Come drink and thirst no more!\\
  Behold, the living waters flow,\\
  Come drink and thirst no more!
  \end{verse}
