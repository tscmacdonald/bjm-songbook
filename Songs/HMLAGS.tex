\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\\
\begin{chorus}
My young man doesn't need my love and he doesn't need my money\\
Give him just a pint of ale and a day that's blue and sunny\\
Oh to see him leaping high, to a sky the shade of honey\\
Oh the lovely morris lads, and their hats so blooming bonny
\end{chorus}


One fine day the morris came over the rosy grasses\\
Challenged all the locals, saying `Who here can surpass us?'\\
Now the whisky, now the stout, now a trembling tower of glasses\\
Then they thumped `em with their sticks and kicked `em up the arses

He is sure to have a ball before the day of marriage\\
From his flowers to his bells, oh there's naught to be disparaged\\
Rumours fly among the lasses, for although he does look savage,\\
Rarely need we to bestow the award for Mr. Average

In a crowded pub we cannot help but to rebel\\
While round about the people all encourage a firm farewell\\
Come and sing and block `em out and ignore `em as they heckle,\\
Until we get us all kicked out for blocking up the stairwell

We'll pour you into bed tonight, when you've had your frolic,\\
But first have another one on me, you charming alcoholic\\
Helter-skelter handsome boys, have you hollow legs to store it\\
When you wake up in the morning light, still in your bells and baldric?

\begin{chorus}
My young man hasn't half a brain nor has he any money\\
Give him half a pint of ale and he swears he is your honey\\
Oh to see him leap away into a day now blue and sunny\\
Oh the bloody morris lads don't deserve a lass so bonny!
\end{chorus}
