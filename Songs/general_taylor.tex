\begin{patverse}
General Taylor gained the day,\\
\textit{Walk him along, John, carry him along}\\
Oh General Taylor gained the day\\
\textit{Carry him to his burial ground}
\end{patverse}


\begin{chorus}
To me way, hey, you Stormy!\\
Walk him along, John, carry him along\\
Way hey, Stormy!\\
Carry him to his burial ground
\end{chorus}

Oh I wish I was old Stormy's son\\
I'd build a ship of ten thousand ton

I'd load that ship up with ale and rum,\\
And every shellback should have some

We'll dig his grave with a silver spade\\
His shroud of the finest silk will be made

We'll lower him down on a golden chain\\
On every link we'll inscribe his name

General Taylor's dead and gone\\
Oh, General Taylor's dead and gone

\end{verse}
