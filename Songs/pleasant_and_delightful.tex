\begin{patverse}
It was pleasant and delightful on a midsummer's day,\\
When the green field and meadows were all covered in hay\\
And the blackbirds and thrushes sang on every green spray,\\
And the larks they sang melodious, at the dawning of the day\\
\textit{And the larks they sang melodious,\\
And the larks they sang melodious,\\
And the larks, they sane melodious\\
At the dawning of the day.}
\end{patverse}

\begin{patverse}
Now a sailor and his true love were a-walking one day\\
Said the sailor to his true love: `I am bound far away.\\
I'm bound for the East Indies, where the loud cannons roar;\\
And I'm bound to leave you Nancy, you're the girl that I adore'\\
\textit{And I'm bound to leave you Nancy\dots{}}
\end{patverse}


Then the ring from off her finger she instantly drew\\
Saying: `Take this, dearest William, and my heart shall go too'\\
And as they were embracing, tears from her eye fell\\
Saying: `May I go along with you?' `Oh no, my love, farewell.'

`Fare thee well my dearest Nancy, I may no longer stay\\
For the topsails they are hoisted, and the anchor's away\\
And the ship she lies waiting, in the fast and flowing tide\\
And if ever I return again, I will make you my bride'
\end{verse}
