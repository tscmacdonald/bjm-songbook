\poemtitle{Here We Come a-Wassailing}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

Here we come a-wassailing\\
Among the leaves so green,\\
Here we come a-wandering\\
So fair to be seen


\begin{chorus}
Love and joy come to you,\\
And to you your wassail too,\\
And God bless you, and send you \\
A Happy New Year,\\
And God send you a Happy New Year
\end{chorus}

We are not daily beggars\\
That beg from door to door,\\
But we are neighbours' children\\
Whom you have seen before


Call up the butler of this house\\
Put on his golden ring\\
And to bring us up a pint of beer\\
And better we shall sing


We have got a little purse\\
Of stretching leather skin\\
We want a little of your money\\
To line it well within


God bless the master of this house,\\
The mistress also,\\
And all the little children\\
That round the table go


And all your kin and kinsfolk\\
That dwell both far and near,\\
We wish you Merry Christmas\\
And Happy New Year
\end{verse}
