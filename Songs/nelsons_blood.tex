\poemtitle{A Drop of Nelson's Blood}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
A drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm,\\
No a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm,\\
And a drop of Nelson's blood wouldn't do us any harm,\\
And we'll all hang on behind.

\begin{chorus}
And we'll roll the old chariot along,\\
We'll roll that golden chariot along,\\
And we'll roll the old chariot along,\\
And we'll all hang on behind.
\end{chorus}

And a night on the town wouldn't do us any harm\dots\\
And we'll all hang on behind.

\textit{etc}

\end{verse}
